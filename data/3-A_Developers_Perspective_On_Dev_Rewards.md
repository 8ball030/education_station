title: A Developers Perspective On Dev Rewards

Intro

1,204,075.95

That is the amount of OLAS my NFTs have accrued this year.

OLAS.

Not dollars.

I’ll save you pulling out coingecko at today’s prices, that is roughly:

$3,444,981.71

Meaning building on Autonolas has effectively earnt me approximately $10,000 dollars each and every day for the last year.

I am 8baller, or if you have spent any time on the Olas Registry, eighballer.

Here's my github profile in case you think I don't know agents and the framework.

It would be quite hard to miss me as over 30% of the components, agents and services were minted by me over the past 12 months or so.

Leaving my FAANG job to work on OLAS was a highly, highly risky play for me. I had high hopes but at no point did I ever think it would play out like this!
Background & motivations

I entered programming from a slightly different perspective to most, with a background in finance that allowed me to see quite early the potential of blockchain technology.

I started my masters in artificial intelligence in 2017 after leaving finance within 4 weeks of completing a report on disruptive technology that could impact the banking sector.  My thesis was titled “The application of Artificial Intelligence in CryptoCurrency Markets”. I’ve now been in the space for several cycles, firstly as a miner, then a trader and currently as a developer.

I wanted an agent based approach to evolving neural networks such that I could develop populations of agents trading on centralised exchanges and decentralised exchanges.

I had a clear goal of what I wanted to build, but no idea how to build it.

So I started to learn.

Python so I could collect data and place trades.

SQL so I could store the data.

Flask so I could query from any services.

Docker and Kubernetes so that I could run hundreds of agents across many nodes. 

I ate through my free cloud compute credits! I loved programming, standing on the shoulders of giants meant I could use their tools and frameworks. It seemed no problem had not been seen before!  

There were frameworks for making models to predict the future with Tensorflow and Torch, frameworks for talking to databases with SQLalchemy. Django for websites, Flask for just apis.

I was not an experienced developer so I was always searching for solutions to the problems I faced in working with agents. There was nothing at all that quite suited to what I needed. I need a Framework for Agents compatible with crypto, and back when I started, there was only one – Fetch.ai

So I reached out on Linked in to the CTO as I just had to find out more.

I was invited to a hackathon! I had no idea what to expect, but I was very excited to speak to people who knew more about agents than I, and it was there I met David Minarsch for the first time. 

At the hackathon I implemented a reinforcement learning mechanism to try and optimise the agents (while everyone else just ran the existing scripts). My agent didn’t win overall but my approach allowed me to win the innovation award – an eye opener for me. 

I was inspired to start using the Fetch framework immediately. The code was aspirational. The best Python I had ever seen. I just wanted desperately to be able to write code so elegant and well structured. The mapping of the framework against the theoretical concepts I had learnt at university regarding agents was almost a one to one mapping. The potential was immediately apparent.

I was later invited to Diffusion 2019, with Fetch.ai offering to pay for my ticket. What an opportunity! 

So I did. 

But I had no team! So i went on the discord and found rebecca.johnson@datarella.com who was hacking. On her team was phil@creator.bid. I pushed the Fetch.ai framework and we built an entry. 

Of course, we won that as well!

I was hooked. I'd just made more in prizes than working for several months at my part time uni job.

So I built this;

I pushed the code for this back in 2020

https://github.com/8ball030/AutonomousHegician

The Autonomous Hegician. What does it do you ask?

Well, it uses an agent to enable stop losses and take profits on an on chain dex.

Cool right?

David offered me pointers and savagely critiqued my code. He tore it to shreds. I started to call him Machete! I soon realised that my standard of “Well it works right?” was not going to fly here.

There was no good enough here when you're dealing with financial transactions where a rounding error can cost you the bank. I had learnt this the hard way with the 18 decimal points involved in Ethereum. There was only right or wrong.

David is not the kind of guy who suffered wrong to be merged into main.

I soon learnt that.

It was like having a crash course from a world class expert and I felt humbled that such an obviously experienced and talented engineer who was so far ahead of me would take the time to help teach me.

We posted about it on Twitter and it got a lot of traction.

20-30 thousand views. I had never seen so many likes on my socials before.

With so many views there were a few interesting commenters, including an invite to a discord where David Minarsch and Oak were hanging out.

David M, David G and Oak had founded Valory and started to work on something even more ambitious than just a framework for 1 agent. 

They were going to build a framework for running all the agents. The were going to build Olas. Did I want in? 

Hell yes I did.

So I dropped everything else I was doing and jumped on board running the agent academy. We had very little uptake, but a few notable exceptions. 0xArdian, a friend of mine, and Dassy.

I also picked up the devops as I had worked some contracts doing agent work previously and started my web3 consulting company. It was a natural fit and I could show off the framework I was so proud to have finally been a part of.

I started going to every hackathon I could. ETHAMS which was the very first ever official entry of the Autonolas stack into a hackathon. 

We dominated. And won all of the prizes.

To begin with, Olas was stumbling around, before OpenAi no one knew what an agent was. Even now I am not sure that the majority of people claiming to be an expert actually have any understanding of what an agent is and does, can do and what that means in terms of potential.

Money became tight. We were not making revenue and bleeding funds. My friends were having their hours reduced.

I ramped up my hackathon attendance, at every hackathon talking about the protocol, winning prizes and minting the components on chain.

Almost every hack I was able to reuse stuff I'd already built, building cooler and cooler stuff.

Hacks and NFTs

Eth Prague where we built the plantation station and won a grand prize. The plantation station uses the framework to tend a plant and paints a picture of a world where our plants are monitored, managed and tracked by a global open source ai.

Eth AMS All Stars Track. A Multi agent system controlling a vault for decentralised Option trading.

What I love about Olas is the ability to build on what I have already built.

Eth NYC where we built the innovation station, an agent service to make more agent components
https://ethglobal.com/showcase/innovation-st-44d4v



Eth online where we built the faucetation station, a decentralised liquidation service to democratise liquidation in money markets.




Eth Denver where we built the speculation station. Which used an EEG device to allow your agent to read your thoughts and instantly buy or sell shitcoins.




My work has inspired people to commit their time, effort and attention to the protocol as it was being built. Its been used by others to bring attention to the project and to highlight the potential. Because of me, some of the best developers in the space have had eyes on our code.
I can say with utmost certainty, without my building Olas would have had way less attention.


My intentions

Firstly, after all these years the market has finally understood how important and revolutionary the concept of agentic development is. I have an unprecedented head start in an emerging industry that is at the beginnings of an exponential increase in adoption thanks to Openai.

Why would I stop when the market is finally recognising what I have been shouting about for 7 years of hard work? 

I am not going anywhere.

What am I going to do with all the NFTs and OLAS I have accrued? 

Well I'm glad you asked. Firstly, I want to put your mind at ease.

I will be re-locking a significant portion of the tokens for the next few years.

I would like more voting power. I have spent a long time working on this protocol and i'd like a say over what goes on. I feel I’ve earnt that.

I have a lot more ideas and things I'd like to build and I'm in a unique position to have the resources to be able to build everything I have ever wanted with the framework. As you can see I have a lot of ideas about what could be done on the stack.

I cannot express how much this means to me, and I want to assure holders that I will not be dumping tokens onto the market haphazardly.

I do not have exact plans for how I intend to use each exact NFT.

But I can tell in general. I will be locking a significant portion to increase my voting power. 

I will be locking in the order 800k OLAS of the 1.2m I have accrued. However as has been rightly pointed out gas is very expensive. 

So, in the interim I will be storing all of my solo nfts in a multisig which I will share to keep the community at ease

At the same time, I will be looking to scale what I do so that I can continue to contribute towards the ecosystem.

Which means that in order to attract top talent to work with me, I will need to be able to fund that.

However, I have strategized about this, and I have already made partnerships and multi-sigs with people who I’d like to partner with.

Roughly 350k OLAS is in multisigs with developers who helped me develop these components, and others who believed in me along the way and proved that.

Does this mean I’m going to immediately sell 350k OLAS?

No, of course not.

I'm going to make the Stations Station.

I'm going to invest in servers and infrastructure and close trusted people such that I can scale what I am doing already as and when I need to.

I am not trying to run a startup and scale to 100s of employees. I want to hire my closest friends, those that I know are fantastic and leagues ahead of the rest. They need certainty as they have not been here like I have.

I am trying to make the best possible tooling for myself and those that come after me such that I can continue to do what I love to do, which is hack cool stuff on the Olas network and run agent services.

Will I ever sell any Olas?

-> Yes. I will be looking to sell some OLAS over the next year or so, however this will not be a market sale, but rather a uniswap v3 position where I can collect sustainable trading fees. It will be a proprtionally insignficant amount.

To run a business and to pay the best developers in the world, you need funds.

The Dev rewards provide me with the confidence to offer the best devs that I know jobs, to come and help me scale.
